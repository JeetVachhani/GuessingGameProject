<h1 align="center">Guessing Game</h1>
<p align="left"><strong>Description</strong>
<br>This guessing game is loosely inspired by https://en.akinator.com. To play the game you must first think of a random animal. Then the program asks a series of questions to the user, to which a yes or no answer is given. Once the necessary amount of questions are asked, the program will make a guess to what "animal" you have chosen. If the guess is wrong, the program will ask for the answer and a question which leads to this answer and add it to the game's database. The program will also automatically create a path to reach this answer from the series of questions. Everytime the game is played, more data is added to the database; therefore the next user will also have this answer avialable. Since there is a database, the game will not reset everytime the program is compiled and excecuted. </p>
